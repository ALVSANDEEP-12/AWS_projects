AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. I can create templates for the service or application architectures you want and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”).

NOTE:Create a key pair first.

Step 1: Create Stack and choose the option Create template in Designer.
Step 2: Paste the JSON code in “Template” tab i.e..
 can get the code which is named as "new.json" format below.

Step 3: Create a stack that at top left button and already file location is 
updated-->next-->S3-EC2-SecurityGroup(stack name)

I had created keypair already from ec2 instances i.e..” projectkey”

Step 4: Click ->Create Stack
Step 5: Check EC2, S3 bucket and Security group created or not?
